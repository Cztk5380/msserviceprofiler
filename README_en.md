## Overview

This document describes the profiling tool (msServiceProfiler) for inference serving. The msServiceProfiler APIs collect start and end times for key processes, identify main functions or iterations, and record important events during the MindIE and vLLM inference serving. msServiceProfiler profiles various data and helps pinpoint performance issues quickly.

## Directory Structure

The key directories are as follows. For details, see [Project Directory](docs/en/dir_structure.md).
